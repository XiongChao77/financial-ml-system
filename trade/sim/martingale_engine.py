"""Self-contained long martingale simulator with a worst-of-two-paths bar model.

No backtrader, no venue, no broker adapter: this module owns the whole ledger
(fees, leverage, initial margin, maintenance margin, forced liquidation) and
consumes plain OHLC floats.

Why two paths per bar
---------------------
Every safety order changes the latest layer entry and therefore resets both
layer boundaries. So ``Open -> Low -> High -> Close`` is *not* automatically the
worst intrabar route: reaching Low first can lower the dynamically recalculated take-profit price
enough for the later High to close the cycle, while reaching High first may
miss the old take profit and then leave a larger position open after the fall.
Which one hurts more depends on the numbers, so both are replayed from the same
snapshot and the worse outcome is kept:

    path A: Open -> Low  -> High -> Close
    path B: Open -> High -> Low  -> Close

"Worse" is ordered as (1) liquidation, (2) lower mark-to-market equity at
Close, and (3) larger position notional carried into the next bar. Ruin is a
backtest-level capital rule; the engine only records realized grid breaks,
liquidations and mark-to-market extrema. Intrabar equity and margin extrema are
tracked on the selected path rather than only at the bar close.

Within one leg the price moves monotonically, so events fire in strict price
order: liquidation, then full-grid break, then the next safety order on the way
down; the take profit on the way up.  Every event re-prices the ones after it.

Layer boundaries
----------------
At layer ``i`` both price boundaries use ``grid_deviation_pcts[i]`` from the
explicit grid list. The favourable boundary takes profit; the adverse boundary
enters the next layer, or stops the cycle once the list is exhausted.
``take_profit_pct`` is only the fixed cash target as a share of the cycle's
starting balance. Before a base order is opened, the simulator prices the whole
planned grid and rejects the cycle if any scheduled layer would breach the
margin cap.
